//Question About Streak State Persistence
//
//Hi [Professor Name],
//
//I’m currently implementing streak tracking in my iOS habit app.
//
//At the moment, I’ve identified two possible approaches:
//
//Option 1 – Navigation-Level State (In-Memory Only)
//
//The streak data is stored in a shared controller.
//
//Streaks remain correct when navigating between views.
//
//However, streak data resets if the app is closed or restarted.
//
//Simpler implementation.
//
//Option 2 – Persistent State (Saved Across App Restarts)
//
//Streak data is stored persistently (e.g., UserDefaults / SwiftData).
//
//Streaks remain correct even after closing and reopening the app.
//
//More realistic production behaviour.
//
//Slightly more complex implementation.
//
//From a marking criteria perspective, would you prefer:
//
//A correct navigation-level state solution,
//or
//
//Full persistence across app sessions?
